"""Verify that a multi-year ecLand run is genuinely restart-chained.

Why this exists: the annual restart chain can fail *silently*. Before commit
4f0ad4e, run_liaise_ecland.{sh,slurm} staged the previous year's restart as
restartin.nc and set LNF=.FALSE., but the offline driver only calls RDRES when
NSTART /= 0 and the script always starts each year at NSTART=0 -- so the staged
restart was never read and every year cold-started from soilinit, with no error
message and no obvious signature in the output.

Do NOT try to diagnose this from the namelist: the signature is counter-
intuitive and inverting it is easy -- it has already caused one wrong verdict.
`LNF=.TRUE.` with no restart_in.nc is the FIXED configuration (the previous
restart is linked *as* soilinit); `LNF=.FALSE.` with a staged restart_in.nc is
the BROKEN one. Test the model state instead,
which is unambiguous:

  1. January states across years: a cold-started run begins every year from the
     same soilinit, so its 1 January fields are near-identical year to year. A
     chained run's differ, because each year inherits the previous December.
  2. Year-boundary continuity: 31 December -> 1 January is one hour, so a
     chained run is continuous there. A cold-started run jumps.

Both are unit-free ratios of the same field, so no unit conversion is needed.

    python3 run/verify_restart_chain.py --run-root $PERM/liaise_ctl_1988_2024
    python3 run/verify_restart_chain.py --run-root A --run-root B   # compare runs

Exit status is 0 if every run checked is chained, 1 otherwise, so this can gate
a pipeline.
